# css-only snippets

A personal stash of CSS-only tricks, utilities, layouts, and weird stuff that just works. No JS. No frameworks. Just CSS.

## Why?

I always forget cool CSS stuff I’ve tried before, so this is my brain dump for future me. If you find it useful, feel free to grab anything.

## How to use

Just copy-paste whatever you need. Most snippets are self-contained and work anywhere.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-path/styles.css" />
