# css-only snippets

ðŸ§  A personal stash of CSS-only tricks, utilities, layouts, and weird stuff that just works. No JS. No frameworks. Just CSS.

## âš¡ Why?

I always forget cool CSS stuff Iâ€™ve tried before, so this is my brain dump for future me. If you find it useful, feel free to grab anything.

## ðŸš€ How to use

Just copy-paste whatever you need. Most snippets are self-contained and work anywhere.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="your-path/styles.css" />
